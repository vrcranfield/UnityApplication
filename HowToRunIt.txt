The exe can be reached at Thesis_Source_Code/unity-menu/unity_player.exe but do not expect to see wonderfull things.
The application is suited to work along with Paraview that provides the CFD data.

You can find a fully detailed guide on how to successfully build and install ParaUnity here: https://github.com/vrcranfield/ParaviewUnity
Be carefull with the PREREQUISITES part of RUNNING WITH A SCENE chapter: Here there is no need to click on the link
	because the scene is already in the Thesis Source Code folder.
The Unity 5.6.1f1 installer is also in the Thesis Source Code folder.
